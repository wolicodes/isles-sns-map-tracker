# Isles of Sea & Sky Map Tracker

### What is this?

This is a very raw map tracker for this awesome game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233070/Isles_of_Sea_and_Sky/
Basically it serves as a notepad for the main islands: you click on the map cell you're in, and you take notes.
Everything you write is saved in localStorage. The reset button clears it, and it doesn't have a confirmation so be wary.

### Commands

Click on a cell: enter `edit` mode
Enter: validate the notes and exit `edit` mode
Shift + Enter: Insert new line in notes
Input 'X' in the cell: Insert a big red cross, for when you fully cleared this cell.
